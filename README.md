## Tailwind 

1. Prefer pre-built components/variants wherever possible
2. If not possible, prefer adding extraClasses to the component (try to do whatever it takes to avoid conflicting classes)
3. In special occasions, where styles are dynamically coming from js, we can opt for important (!) or inline styles.
